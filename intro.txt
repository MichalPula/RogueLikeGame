You are a handsome prince in the prime of life. 
Unfortunately you are lonely and you are looking for the only one. 
Apparently the princess lives behind the mountains and forests. 
However, her virtue is closely guarded by a threatening Dragon. 
To get it you have to go through the land full of dangerous thugs 
and finally release from the hands of the big Dragon by answering his riddle.
